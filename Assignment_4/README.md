# Assigment_4

## C++


Make a new project which draws only the object with a face from the last assignment.

Move the shapes you used to create the face (adding more if necessary) to express:

happiness
sadness
surprise
anger
In setup() set your framerate to 60 fps and set all shapes to their initial locations.

Move all shapes to their final destinations in 1 second and show each emotion for 2 seconds in a slideshow using ofGetFrameNum and the c++ modulo operator.
