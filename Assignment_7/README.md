# Assignment_7

## C++

Assignment
Create a new project using the code from the last emotion assignment.

Remove all timer related changes and movement.

Create a UI with the following:

An ofxFloatSlider to control the sound volume
An ofxButton to rotate between which emotion is being displayed
An ofxVec2Slider to change the x,y of all shapes being drawn
An ofxColorSlider to select the color of one shape in the drawing
An ofxIntSlider shape movement (degree of emotion)
Appropriate labels
Use translation, scaling, and rotation to add at least 3 new features to the existing emotions.

Ex:

Y rotation could make eyes squint/blink or eyebrows arch.

Scaling could widen eyes in surprise or narrow them in distrust

Translation could move pupils (or any other feature) around.

Questions
What are the first 4 arguments of the slider setup method?

From the guiExample .h file, what types of sliders are available?

If the difference between them is in their return value, what do they return and how does this affect the values you can pass to setup?
