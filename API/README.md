# API

## C++

## Project2:
### Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15
Your goal is to translate a JSON data source into an intelligible visual form. All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). The deliverable is not required to be a dashboard with associated UI (as you might see on a mobile). You are incouraged to think non-literally about the data source and and imagine an innovative or engaging experience that could be derived from the structure.

Since all projects will cover a domain of time, a slider for each variable is required for testing.

Requirements
The visualization will include color, shapes, movement, text, fonts

A UI to manually change each variable used

A github link submitted to canvas with code, process assets, and the appropriate .md information

An explanation of your process in the .md

Optional
Alternate web-APIs will be provided in class. If you want to use a different API, come to me having already looked at the returned JSON data structure and propose your concept. If I approve, you can use it.

### My API project:

Comparing the weather of my hometown Tehran and New York city's using Dark sky API.

Adding texts and fonts:

Adding color: The color range is between blue and red, the lower temprature makes the color more blue and the warmer tempratures makes it more red.

The size of the circles changes with the temprature. The warmer weather makes a bigger circle.
