# Three Projects

## C++


## Concept Description for mt three projects
### - Who is the user?
### - What do you want them to experience?
### - How will your translation achieve this?

## Project1:
#### Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15
Your goal is to relate a narrative using primitive shapes, colors, sound and movement. All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). It is highly recommended that you choose a story you are invested in telling and feel strongly about. The experience itself should require around 5 minutes from the user.

#### Requirements
Your story should include shapes (incl. polygons), movement, sound, images

At least two "scenes" (You can scroll between scenes or draw a new one)

A 5 minute experience

A github link submitted to canvas with code, process assets, and the appropriate .md information

An explanation of your process in the .md

## Project2:
#### Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15
Your goal is to translate a JSON data source into an intelligible visual form. All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). The deliverable is not required to be a dashboard with associated UI (as you might see on a mobile). You are incouraged to think non-literally about the data source and and imagine an innovative or engaging experience that could be derived from the structure.

Since all projects will cover a domain of time, a slider for each variable is required for testing.

#### Requirements
The visualization will include color, shapes, movement, text, fonts

A UI to manually change each variable used

#### Optional
Alternate web-APIs will be provided in class. If you want to use a different API, come to me having already looked at the returned JSON data structure and propose your concept. If I approve, you can use it.

## Project3:
#### Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15
Your goal is to create a simple game. All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from	online sources). Focus on simple mechanics and interactions and how you can engage with a user through a coherent visual and auditory style including but not limited to character creation and setting. You can optinally go for a typical score-based game or interactive story style experience.

#### Examples
Look on video sites for playthroughs of:
Sushi Cat: Coherent visual/auditory experience
Flappy Bird: Simple low interaction
PacMan: Low resource, simple color pallette
Canabalt: Low concept excellent soundtrack
Pinocchio: Interactive fiction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRXHqFv365Y
#### Requirements
The visualization will include color, shapes, movement, images, sound, user interaction, collisions, matrix transforms

## Drawings:

### PROJECT1: 
- CONCEPT: ISOLATION
Using a Kinect. The kinect traces the body's silhouette, when the user moves, all the existing shapes in the space ran away from him/her.

### PROJECT2: 
- Translating weather to sounds.(sunny=> pop, cloudy=>classic, etc.)
- Translating weather to colors.
- Translating weather to shapes.

### PROJECT3:
- Using face tracker.
- Playing with facial features (eyebrows' movement, blinking, etc.)
- Body silhouette as the play ground.
- Using kinect.
