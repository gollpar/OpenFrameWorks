# Assignment_12

Create a new project.

Create a global ball balls[10];

Create a ball class that has:

Property: position
Property: velocity/direction vector
Property: color
Property: index
Method: Constructor
Method: draw
Method: update
In the constructor initialize the properties:

position: the middle of the screen
velocity/direction vector: Random between 4-10
color: start with solid red
index: the index of this object in the global array
In ball::draw:

Draw the circle at the current position with the current color

In ball::update:

If the ball has a collision with another ball or the side of a window, reverse the direction and reduce the velocity by 10%. If the ball has a velocity of < 1 create a new object in the ball array. (see below)

In update:

Call the update method for each ball object.

In draw:

Call the update method for each ball object.

Create two unique rules in ball::update. One should affect the ball color, one should affect the ball vector.

Examples:

Color gets darker and more transparent as velocity deminishes
In ball update, check the distance of all other balls. If the distance to any other ball is below a threshold, modify your vector to gravitate towards or be repelled by that ball.
