# Story

## C++

## Project1:
#### Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15
Your goal is to relate a narrative using primitive shapes, colors, sound and movement. All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). It is highly recommended that you choose a story you are invested in telling and feel strongly about. The experience itself should require around 5 minutes from the user.

#### Requirements
Your story should include shapes (incl. polygons), movement, sound, images

At least two "scenes" (You can scroll between scenes or draw a new one)

A 5 minute experience

A github link submitted to canvas with code, process assets, and the appropriate .md information

An explanation of your process in the .md
