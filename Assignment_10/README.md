Create a method that takes the arguments: ofPoint origin, int numTriangles;

The function should:

Translate to "origin"
Rotate around origin in steps of 360/numTriangles
Draw a triangle (pointing outwards) at each step
For each triangle drawn, if numTriangles > 1 call yourself with the arguments (tip of drawn triangle, numTriangles - 1);
Call the function in draw with the arguments (center of screen, 4) Create a slider to modify the number called within the domain of 1 - 20

Use numTriangles to refine triangle width/height, color, and transparency
